# Splitting

## What is it?

Splitting occurs when the player has two cards which have the same face, and allows the player to play with two hands instead of one.

The player then has these cards placed face up, and recieves one new face down card for each new hand.

> Example Hand: [JS, JC]
>
> New Hands: [JS, FACEDOWN], [JC, FACEDOWN]
