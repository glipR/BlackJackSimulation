# Turn

## What is a turn?

Blackjack is played in rounds (turns) around the table.

Every player is prompted to take their turn, which includes betting and recieving cards

## Breakdown

### First Turn

On the first turn, the player first has to place the minimum bet on the board (This is required to play the game).

Once everyone has placed their beginning bet, 2 cards are dealt to every player, the first face up and the second face down (The player recieving the cards can see both, however)

After this, each player is given the option to "surrender". Surrendering means recieving half your minimum bet back and abstaining from the game to follow, and is only good if you are confident you will lose the game to come.

Once this has been decided, players are allowed to split. See splitting.md for more info.

This concludes the setup turn, and from then on until a winner is decided, a general turn is repeatedly done.

### General turn

On a general turn, each player does the following in a circle:

* Player makes a betting option
* Player makes a dealing option
* Go to next player

### Betting options.

Each of the bets made in the game go into a "pool", which is recieved by the winning player(s).

When in a betting round, in order to stay in the game, your current bet must match that of the pool's.

When betting you have the following options:

* RAISE - Make your current bet more than that of the pool's, forcing everyone else to bet.
* STAND - If your current bet is the same as the pool's you can leave it as is.
* MATCH - If your current bet is less than that of the pool's, you can bet up to that point.
* FOLD - If you no longer wish to bet, yet your current bet is lower than that of the pool's, you must fold (forfeit the match).

When dealing, you can do the following:

* HIT - Recieve a new card, face up, to add to your hand
* STAND - Keep your hand at its current state, you can no longer recieve cards for this hand

The general round only stops once all remaining players with valid hands have decided to stand on their cards, and stand on their bets, in a circle.

## End game

Once all remaining players have stood, it's time to compare cards.

Every winner decided by this hand comparison receives an even split of the betting pool back.
